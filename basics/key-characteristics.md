## Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems

### Scalability
- the capacity to grow and manage increases demand
- achieve scaling without performance loss
- horizontal scaling
  - add more servers
  - Cassandra and MongoDB
- vertical scaling
  - add more power(CPU, RAM, storage, etc.)
  - MySQL

### Reliability
- the probability a system will fail in a given period
- system is reliable as if it keeps delivering its service even when one or more software and hardware components fail
- Reliability is achieved through redundancy of components and data (remove every single point of failure).

### Availability
- the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period
- measured by the percentage of time that a system remains operational under normal conditions

### Reliability Vs. Availability
- reliable is avaliable
- avaliable is not necessarily reliable

### Efficiency
- latency
- throughput

### Serviceability or Manageability
- the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired and maintained
